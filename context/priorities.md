# Current Priorities

_Last updated: 2026-04-16 — Footage Organizer rebuilt with full 00–07 folder structure, deployed to /Volumes/Footage/Sai + Graydient, first real test run with FX3 footage in progress_
_Update this file whenever your focus shifts._

> **⚡ MAJOR FOCUS SHIFT 2026-04-15:** Sai Karra job begins — 5h filming + 3h editing daily, 1 short/day + 1 LinkedIn/day + 1 long-form/week. Primary income + primary creative output. Debrief materials at `plans/2026-04-15-sai-debrief-content-strategy.md` (strategy), `plans/2026-04-15-sai-debrief-research-deepdive.md` (intel dump), `plans/2026-04-15-sai-footage-organization-system.md` (filing system). All internal-project work below secondary to Sai deliverables until stable cadence established (~Day 30).

## Scoring Framework

Each project scored 0–3 across 4 dimensions:
1. Unblocks something else
2. Direct revenue or time impact
3. Showcase / social media value
4. Builds toward a sellable product

**Tiebreaker:** simpler/faster project goes first.
