# Current Priorities

_Last updated: 2026-04-19 (late evening) — Footage Organizer overhauled and live-tested: format detection switched from 4K-resolution to orientation-only (long-form is now shot 1080p horizontal); 17 mutually-exclusive categories with strict "miscellaneous when uncertain" rule; new eval harness (`eval.py`) for measurable prompt iteration; B-roll archive now bucketed by Monday-of-week. Test run on 2026-04-18 (33 clips) and 2026-04-19 (18 clips) succeeded — total ~$0.15. Awaiting Gray's manual review of misses tomorrow at Sai's lunch. Earlier today: Content Pipeline voice-memo flow fully live on Windows GPU (RTX 5070, CUDA 12.8); 10 .m4a transcribed → `Obsidian/Graydient Media/Voice Memos/` with `_Index.md` hub + backlinks; script patched (`--all` accepts folder path, filename date-prefix parsed, auto-backlink, env var `OBSIDIAN_VOICE_MEMOS`). Source-of-truth memo: 2026-04-19 New Recording 7 (5 PM) = current content system (one weekly vlog + 3 daily shorts, 1080p)._
_Update this file whenever your focus shifts._

> **⚡ MAJOR FOCUS SHIFT 2026-04-15:** Sai Karra job begins — 5h filming + 3h editing daily, 1 short/day + 1 LinkedIn/day + 1 long-form/week. Primary income + primary creative output. Debrief materials at `plans/2026-04-15-sai-debrief-content-strategy.md` (strategy), `plans/2026-04-15-sai-debrief-research-deepdive.md` (intel dump), `plans/2026-04-15-sai-footage-organization-system.md` (filing system), `plans/2026-04-16-sai-format-shooting-scripts.md` (on-set shooting scripts for every format + series). All internal-project work below secondary to Sai deliverables until stable cadence established (~Day 30).

## Scoring Framework

Each project scored 0–3 across 4 dimensions:
1. Unblocks something else
2. Direct revenue or time impact
3. Showcase / social media value
4. Builds toward a sellable product

**Tiebreaker:** simpler/faster project goes first.

## Active Priority List

| # | Project | Score | Status | Next Action |
|---|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Content Pipeline | 9/12 | LIVE on Windows GPU (CUDA 12.8). 10 voice memos transcribed 2026-04-19 → `Voice Memos/` vault folder + index. Filename date-prefix parsing + auto-backlink shipped. | For future memos: drop `.m4a` in `C:/Users/Gray Davis/My Drive/Voice Memos/` with `YYYY-MM-DD - ` prefix, run `python main.py "C:/Users/Gray Davis/My Drive/Voice Memos" --meeting-notes --all`. Upgrade: iOS Shortcut or Just Press Record app to auto-prefix dates. |
| 2 | Content Researcher | 9/12 | LIVE on Windows + Mac (agent loop + Reddit already exist) | Docs out of date — content-researcher.md describes old 5-step pipeline, actual code is agentic |
| 3 | Client Onboarding | 7/12 | Built on Windows | Fill .env, review contract template |
| — | Social Media Analytics | 9/12 | LIVE — Instagram data broken (scraper) | Meta app configured (4 permissions added) — next: get access token from Graph API Explorer, add to .env, swap main.py to meta_fetcher |
| 5 | Hook Optimizer | 6/12 | LIVE on Windows (real .env key set 2026-04-13) | Add .env on Mac |
| 6 | Creator Intel | 5/12 | Built on Windows | Needs YouTube OAuth |
| 7 | Morning Briefing | 4/12 | Built on Windows | Needs full .env setup |
| 8 | Footage Organizer | 8/12 | LIVE on Windows. Rebuilt 2026-04-19 with orientation-only format, 17 categories, eval harness, week-folder archive. 51 clips test-classified (2026-04-18 + 2026-04-19). | Gray reviews misses tomorrow at Sai's lunch → reports per-clip wrong-folder list → tighten prompt for worst-confused pair → re-run. Cycle until accuracy plateau. Cache cleared, originals safe in RAW/. |
